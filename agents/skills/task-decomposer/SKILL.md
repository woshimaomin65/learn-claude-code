# Task Decomposer Skill

This skill provides a systematic approach to breaking down complex tasks into actionable steps, identifying the right skills for each step, and optimizing execution through parallel processing and subagent delegation.

## Purpose

To enable efficient task execution by:
1. Analyzing user requests to identify all required steps
2. Mapping each step to the most appropriate skill or MCP tool
3. Identifying opportunities for parallel execution
4. Determining when to use subagents for isolated work
5. Creating organized output structures

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Task Analysis
1. **Understand the Goal**: What is the user trying to accomplish?
2. **Identify Constraints**: Are there deadlines, format requirements, or specific tools needed?
3. **Determine Dependencies**: What steps must happen before others?
4. **Assess Complexity**: Is this a single-step task or multi-phase project?

### Phase 2: Skill & MCP Mapping
Map each task component to the appropriate skill or MCP tool. Use the reference below.

### Phase 3: Execution Planning
1. **Sequential Steps**: Steps that must happen in order
2. **Parallel Opportunities**: Steps that can run concurrently
3. **Delegation Candidates**: Tasks suitable for subagents or teammates

### Phase 4: Output Organization
ALWAYS create a task folder in `data/` directory:
```
data/{task-name}-{date}/
├── README.md          # Task overview and status
├── inputs/            # Source materials
├── outputs/           # Final deliverables
├── work/              # Intermediate files
└── assets/            # Images, templates, etc.
```

# Parallel Execution Analysis

Identify parallel opportunities using these patterns:

### Independent Data Processing
```
Task: Process 10 CSV files
Parallel Strategy: Use concurrent-execution to process files simultaneously
```

### Multi-Source Research
```
Task: Research competitors A, B, C
Parallel Strategy: Spawn subagents for each competitor using web-browsing
```

### Document Assembly
```
Task: Create presentation with 5 sections
Parallel Strategy: Research each section in parallel, then assemble with pptx
```

### Multi-Format Output
```
Task: Create report in Word, PDF, and presentation formats
Parallel Strategy: Generate all formats concurrently after content is ready
```

### Project Module Development
```
Task: Build multiple independent modules in a large project
Parallel Strategy: Use architecture-master to design, then spawn teammates for each module
```

# Best Practices

## Always
- Create organized folder structure in `data/`
- Identify parallel execution opportunities
- Map each step to specific skills or MCP tools
- Consider subagent delegation for isolated tasks
- Document sources and assumptions
- For large projects, use architecture-master skill

## Never
- Start complex tasks without decomposition
- Ignore existing skill capabilities
- Hardcode values in spreadsheets (use formulas)
- Copy existing artists' work (create original content)
- Use wrong skill for file type (e.g., pdf skill for .xlsx)
- Modify code without understanding project structure first

## Quality Checks
- Verify all formula errors are resolved (xlsx)
- Confirm research sources are cited
- Ensure visual designs are original
- Test web applications before delivery
- Review document formatting consistency
- Verify architecture decisions are documented

- Short-lived exploration work

## Use `spawn_teammate` for:
- Long-running autonomous work
- Tasks requiring ongoing coordination
- Complex multi-phase projects
- Work needing persistent state
- Module development in large projects

## Use `concurrent-execution` skill for:
- Batch processing
- Multiple independent file operations
- Parallel research queries
- Simultaneous format generation

## Use architecture-master for:
- Large-scale project planning
- Language migration projects
- System architecture design
- Major refactoring efforts
- Multi-language development
